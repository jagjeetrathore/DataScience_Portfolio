## [Project:1:-Clustering(Customer Segmenation):](https://github.com/jagjeetrathore/E-Commerce-System)
#### Objective:(Predict Customer Life Time Value- CLTV)
objective is to build a machine learning model to predict the customer Lifetime Value (LTV), a metric that indicates the total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer account. LTV is often considered the “Golden Metric” for online retailers, as it helps predict future revenue and measures long-term business success.
##  [Project:2:-Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/jagjeetrathore/Churn-Prediction)
#### Objective: 
The main objective of this project is to make a model for  Customer Churn prediction based on historical Data. Business can use this model for churn predictions, so that they can take actions before the customers leave their business.

## [Project:3-Classification:](https://github.com/jagjeetrathore/USaccidents)
#### Objective:(Factors for US Accidents)
The main objective of this project is to analyze a real-world accident data (U.S. accident dataset) to find the factors that contribute most to road accidents and also predicting accidents in real-time.This type of analysis can help traffic control departments to incorporate the right factors into their decisions, in order to lower down the severity and/or overall number of accidents.
## [Project:4:-World Happiness Report](https://github.com/jagjeetrathore/WorldHappinessReport)
#### Objective: 
* Preprocessing
* Regression Analysis
* Model Building
